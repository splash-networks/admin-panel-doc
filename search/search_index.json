This guide is written for OpenWRT. Our recommended OpenWRT firmware version is OpenWRT 19. Newer versions do not have <code>iptables</code> installed by default so Coova Chilli will not work out of the box. For newer firmwares we recommend using OpenNDS package instead of Coova Chilli.</p> <p>Access OpenWRT router/AP using LuCI web interface. By default, OpenWRT firewall does not allow web or SSH access on WAN IP. As a captive portal blocks all traffic on LAN until user is authenticated so when we initially enable captive portal on OpenWRT we would lose management access to the router. To manage OpenWRT we should therefore open access from WAN side. </p> <p>Go to Network &gt; Firewall &gt; Traffic Rules. Add a new rule with these properties:</p> <pre><code>Protocol: TCP\nSource zone: wan\nDestination zone: Device (input)\nDestination port: 80\n</code></pre> <p>Similarly, add another rule for <code>Destination port: 22</code>. Click on Save and apply. Once these rules are added you would be able to access OpenWRT via web and SSH from WAN side.</p> <p>Access your OpenWRT device over SSH using its WAN IP. Enter these commands:</p> <pre><code>opkg update\nopkg install coova-chilli nano\n</code></pre> <p>Open coova-chilli config file:</p> <pre><code>nano /etc/config/chilli\n</code></pre> <p>Make the following changes:</p> <p>option disabled 1: should be commented out</p> <p>option radiusserver1 <code>radius IP</code>: the IP of Splash Air should be added here</p> <p>option radiusserver2 rad02.chillispot.org: should be commented out</p> <p>option radiussecret <code>secret</code>: RADIUS secret should be entered here (will be provided by Splash Networks' team)</p> <p>option dhcpif <code>br-lan</code>: LAN interface such as <code>br-lan</code> or <code>eth0</code> should be given here</p> <p>option uamserver <code>Guest Portal URL</code>: the <code>Guest Portal URL</code> created earlier should be added here</p> <p>option uamsecret <code>secret</code>: UAM secret created earlier should be entered here</p> <p>Save and exit.</p> <p>To check chilli runtime settings use this command:</p> <pre><code>cat /var/run/chilli_&lt;config&gt;.conf\n</code></pre> <p>To apply the changes stop and start the service:</p> <pre><code>/etc/init.d/chilli stop\n/etc/init.d/chilli start\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"portals/coova-chilli/#helpful-commands","title":"Helpful commands","text":"<p>Enable/disable service</p> <pre><code>/etc/init.d/chilli enable\n/etc/init.d/chilli disable\n</code></pre> <p>Check online users</p> <pre><code>chilli_query list\n</code></pre> <p>Logout connected user</p> <pre><code>chilli_query logout &lt;MAC address&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>View logs</p> <pre><code>logread -f\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"portals/coova-chilli/#troubleshooting","title":"Troubleshooting","text":"<p>To troubleshoot problems it is important to understand the components involved in the captive portal user authorization process and the interactions between them.</p>"},{"location":"portals/coova-chilli/#traffic-flow","title":"Traffic Flow","text":"<p>Here is the traffic flow in the case of Coova Chilli:</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"portals/datto/","title":"Datto","text":"<p>To set up a portal for Datto first you need to create a template.</p>"},{"location":"portals/datto/#add-a-portal","title":"Add a Portal","text":"<p>To create a portal go to the Portal tab and click on the New portal button.
