To set up a portal for Ruckus One first you need to [create a template](../defining-templates.md).

## Add a Portal

To create a portal go to the Portals tab and click on the New portal button. Enter a name for the portal and specify the business and venue. In Hardware select `Ruckus One`. In Secret enter the integration key obtained in Ruckus One (explained below in **Ruckus One Settings** section).Then, enter a Site ID based on which the path of the portal URL will be defined.

The `Guest Portal URL` will be created based on the URL of the Splash Air application followed by the path given by Site ID. Note this URL as it will be required later.

Select the template and click on the Create button.

## Portal Settings

You can go to Portals to view the settings for the portal(s) just added.

Clicking on a portal takes you to the details for that portal. It lets you specify additional settings:

```
Business Name: name of the venue which will be displayed on top of the portal
Redirect URL: the URL a user is redirected to after successful portal authorization
Expiry: the time in days after which a repeat user will have to enter their data again on the portal
Duration (seconds) after email verification: when using "Link" type Flow it is the "Session-Timeout" a user will receive via RADIUS after successful email verification 
```

You can click on the Edit button against each entry to modify it if needed.

## Ruckus One Settings
