To create a survey go to Surveys tab and click on the New survey button. Enter a name for it. The following options are supported:

- **is active**: toggle switch to enable/disable the survey
- **Email Notification**: if enabled survey results will be emailed to venue admin(s)

Multiple questions can be added, and the **Required** toggle button can be used to control whether the question is mandatory or can be skipped. If all the questions in a survey are not required, then the user can skip the survey altogether.

For each question, the **Type** option controls what kind of response is supported - such as text, number, checkboxes, rating, etc.

Once a survey has been created in can be referenced in a Template.

The survey responses are available in the Survey Answers tab.
